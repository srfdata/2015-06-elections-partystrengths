## Notes

This document illustrates the preprocessing of the dataset visualized in this [article on srf.ch](http://www.srf.ch/news/wahlen-15/wahlkampf/so-haben-die-schweizer-gemeinden-seit-1971-gewaehlt).

SRF Data attaches great importance to transparent and reproducible data preprocessing and -analysis. SRF Data believes in the principles of open data but also open and reproducible methods. Third parties should be empowered to build on the work of SRF Data and to generate new analyses and applications. 

### R-Script & processed data

The preprocessing and analysis of the data was conducted in the [R project for statistical computing](https://www.r-project.org/). The RMarkdown script used to generate this document and all the resulting data can be downloaded [under this link](http://srfdata.github.io/2015-06-elections-partystrengths/rscript.zip). Through executing `main.Rmd`, the herein described process can be reproduced and this document can be generated. In the course of this, data from the folder `ìnput` will be processed and results will be written to `output`. 

### GitHub

The code for the herein described process can also be freely downloaded from [https://github.com/srfdata/2015-06-elections-partystrengths](https://github.com/srfdata/2015-06-elections-partystrengths). Criticism in the form of GitHub issues and pull requests are very welcome!

## Preprocessing

### Municipality data

```{r, echo=T}
# load data
# read in input file (xlsx) - need to load a slightly modified input file as the original xlsx makes it really complicated
raw_data <- read_excel("input/parteienstaerke_mod_2.xlsx", sheet = 1, skip = 12, col_names = T)[1:2345,] # replace this subsetting with bugfix in readxl
parties <- read_excel("input/parteienstaerke_mod_2.xlsx", sheet = 4)[1:24,]
# all years 
years <- seq(1971, 2011, 4)
length(years) # we have 11 different time stamps

# first problem: not all years have the same amount of parties, thus we need to fill up by year
# first split the columns into sets for each year.

# doublecheck that "1" is contained as many times as we have years
table(names(raw_data) == "1")[2] == length(years)
# this is true, so we can split the columns by this column name
indices <- which(names(raw_data) == "1")
yearlyDataframes <- list()
for(i in 1:length(indices)){
  start <- indices[i]
  stop <- if(is.na(indices[i + 1])) ncol(raw_data) else indices[i + 1] - 1 
  yearlyDataframes[[i]] <- prepareYearlyDataForVis(raw_data[,start:stop], years[i])
}
# combine
filled_data <- cbind(raw_data[, 1:indices[1] - 1], yearlyDataframes)
# doublecheck: column numbers should be 2 + 11 * 24
dim(filled_data)[2] == 2 + 11 * 24

# aggregate parties (cf. to column OLD_ID in parties.csv)
for(year in years){
  # FDP
  filled_data <- combineAndDelete(1, c(1, 5), year)
  # Kleine Rechtsparteien
  filled_data <- combineAndDelete(16, c(16, 15, 14, 17), year)
  # Kleine Linksparteien
  filled_data <- combineAndDelete(9, c(9, 27, 10, 11, 12), year)
  # Andere
  filled_data <- combineAndDelete(8, c(8, 6, 26, 35, 33), year)
}
# gather into long form
long_data <- filled_data %>%
  gather(ParteiJahr, Staerke,-c(BFSNr, GdeName))

# add new columns Jahr and Partei from splitted ParteiJahr
long_data %<>% separate(col = ParteiJahr, into = c("Partei","Jahr")) %>%
  mutate(Jahr = as.Date(Jahr, "%Y")) %>%
  tbl_df()


# divide strength values through 100
long_data %<>% mutate(Staerke = Staerke / 100)
# only retain BFSNr
long_data %<>% select(BFSNr, Partei, Jahr, Staerke)
```


### National data

```{r, echo=T}
# country
# read in input file (xlsx) - need to load a slightly modified input file as the original xlsx makes it really complicated
raw_data_country <- read_excel("input/parteienstaerke_national.xlsx", sheet = 1, skip = 0, col_names = T)[1:24,] # replace this subsetting with bugfix in readxl

long_data_country <- raw_data_country %>%
  gather(Jahr, Staerke, -Partei) %>%
  mutate(Jahr = as.Date(Jahr, "%Y")) %>%
  select(Partei, Jahr, Staerke) %>%
  rename(party = Partei, year = Jahr, support = Staerke) %>%
  mutate(support = support / 100, year = as.numeric(format.Date(year, "%Y")))

# aggregate parties
for(year in years){
  # FDP
  long_data_country <- combineAndDeleteCountry(1, c(1, 5), year)
  # Kleine Rechtsparteien
  long_data_country <- combineAndDeleteCountry(16, c(16, 15, 14, 17), year)
  # Kleine Linksparteien
  long_data_country <- combineAndDeleteCountry(9, c(9, 27, 10, 11, 12), year)
  # Andere
  long_data_country <- combineAndDeleteCountry(8, c(8, 6, 26, 35, 33), year)
}

dim(long_data_country)[1] == 11 * 24
# delete incomplete cases
# long_data_country[complete.cases(long_data_country),]

```


## Output

### Copy party data to output

```{r}
parties <- read.csv("input/parties.csv") # same here
write.csv(parties, file = "output/parties.csv", row.names = F, na = "")
```

### Change variable names and doublecheck

```{r}
# change variable names
long_data %<>% rename(year = Jahr, municipality = BFSNr, party = Partei, support = Staerke) %>%
  mutate(year = as.numeric(format.Date(year, "%Y")), party = as.numeric(party))

totalSupport <- long_data %>%
  group_by(year, municipality) %>%
  summarize(total = sum(support, na.rm = T)) %>%
  filter(!(total > 0.999999999 & total < 1.000000001))

totalSupport %>%
  filter(total > 0.0)

```

### By party

```{r}
mainDir <- getwd()
subDir <- "output/by_party"
dir.create(file.path(mainDir, subDir), showWarnings = FALSE)
# For the map, we need 13 files (one for each of the 12 parties or groups of parties, plus one for 'all parties'). Each file represents support for a single party, and contains data for all municipalities in all years. In the case of 'all parties', it's the support for the strongest party in that municipality in that year. 

# split by party and save
for(i in parties$ID){ 
  i <- as.character(i)
  subset_data <- subset(long_data, party == i)
  subset_data <- subset_data[complete.cases(subset_data),]
  write.csv(subset_data, file = paste("output/by_party/party_", i, ".csv", sep = ""), row.names = F)
}

# save value for dominant party in each year/municipality
dominance <- long_data %>%
  group_by(municipality, year) %>%
  arrange(desc(support)) %>%
  # only take the most dominant party in each year
  slice(1) %>%
  ungroup()
# only retain those where support is not NA
subset_data <- dominance[complete.cases(dominance),]
write.csv(subset_data, file = "output/by_party/dominant_party.csv", row.names = F)
```

### By municipality

```{r}
# For the area chart, we need many more files, one for each municipality plus one for all of Switzerland (we estimate that's about 2600 files). Each of these files should contain data for all parties in all years.
mainDir <- getwd()
subDir <- "output/by_municipality"
dir.create(file.path(mainDir, subDir), showWarnings = FALSE)
# split by municipality and save
for(i in unique(long_data$municipality)){ 
  subset_data <- subset(long_data, municipality == i) %>%
    select(party, year, support)
  subset_data <- subset_data[complete.cases(subset_data),]
  # check if support adds up to 100
  totalSupport <- subset_data %>%
    group_by(year) %>%
    summarize(total = sum(support)) %>%
    filter(!(total > 0.999999999 & total < 1.000000001))
  # if it doesn't only retain those cases where it is not 0
  totalSupport %<>%
    filter(!(total < 0.000000001))
  if(dim(totalSupport)[1] != 0){
    warning("Party strengths do not sum up to 1 (or are not 0) in municipality ", i, " and year ", totalSupport$year)
  }
  write.csv(subset_data, file = paste("output/by_municipality/municipality_", i, ".csv", sep = ""), row.names = F)
}
# save a file for whole switzerland
subset_data <- long_data_country[complete.cases(long_data_country),]
# check if support adds up to 100
totalSupport <- subset_data %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(total = sum(support)) %>%
  filter(!(total > 0.999999999 & total < 1.000000001))
if(dim(totalSupport)[1] != 0){
  warning("Party strengths do not sum up to 1 in Switzerland and year ", totalSupport$year)
}
write.csv(subset_data, file = "output/by_municipality/national.csv", row.names = F)
```

### all together

```{r}
alldata <- long_data %>% select(municipality, party, year, support)
# only keep complete cases (e.g. remove NA)
write.csv(alldata[complete.cases(alldata),], "output/partystrengths.csv", row.names = F)
```

### Save municipality names & add translations into separate file 

```{r}
# save municipality names

# first, load municipality name translations (src http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/de/index/infothek/nomenklaturen/blank/blank/gem_liste/03.Document.90142.xls, slightly edited to make it easier to read in)
translated_names <- read_excel("input/gdenamen_translation.xlsx", sheet = 1)[1:75,]
municipalities <- filled_data %>%
  select(BFSNr, GdeName) %>%
  rename(ID = BFSNr, Name_Official = GdeName)
municipalities %<>%
  left_join(translated_names, by = "Name_Official")

write.csv(municipalities, file = "output/municipalities.csv", row.names = F, na = "")
```
